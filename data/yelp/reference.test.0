ever since joes has changed hands it 's just gotten worse and worse
there is definitely not enough room in that part of the venue
so basically tasted watered down
she said she would be back and disappeared for a few minutes
i ca not believe how inconsiderate this pharmacy is
just left and took it off the bill
it is not terrible , but it is not very good either
definitely disappointed that i could not use my birthday gift !
new owner , i heard - but i do not know the details
but it probably sucks too !
we sit down and we got some really slow and lazy service
the charge did include miso soup and a small salad
there was no i am sorry or how did everything come out
said we could not sit at the table if we were not ordering dinner
the cash register area was empty and no one was watching the store front
there chips are ok , but their salsa is really bland
the wine was very average and the food was even less
staffed primarily by teenagers that do not understand customer service
the burgers were over cooked to the point the meat was crunchy
blue cheese dressing was not the best by any means
my pad thai tasted like thai rice noodles with barbeque sauce
she said `` yes , sorry ``
the store is dumpy looking and management needs to change
there was only meat and bread
when i complained in a polite way , i was walked out the door
she was not happy being there
moving past the shape , they were dry and truly tasteless
the associates program is no longer an option
the decor was seriously lacking
anyway , we got our coffee and will not return to this location
the sales people here are terrible
salsa is not hot or good
so i asked for the card to be refunded
i just received a delivery order from them and essentially wasted my money
i was not going to let her do a thing further to me
all she did was give me the run around and lied and bs everything
the beans were in the burro in the rice was nowhere to be found
they tried to take advantage of me because i am young
we have sent enough guests there who have returned absolutely livid with this restaurant
always rude in their tone and always have shitty customer service !
they really need to work on their customer service and general attitude
i skipped eating and we went back to the beer
my `` hot `` sub was cold and the meat was watery
when i first came to phx yes this sounded indian to me
you wo not find a better selection in scottsdale
i asked for thai hot and received very little spice
i was very sick the night after
i left hungry and unsatisfied , never again
i just left this car wash and was very unsatisfied !
had one mediocre meal and said , `` we will try again ``
the food 's ok , the service is among the worst i have encountered
this was my first stop in looking for a wedding dress
then he proceeded to tell me how to fix it
do not go to this practice they are horrible !
i guess she was not happy that we were asking the prices
the only saving grace was the black beans
lost a long time customer !
other than that , food here is pretty gross
i was also curious about another product but he straight up walked off
so far i am not really impressed
my groupon is only for the two windows
safeway has officially lost my business to sprouts , & fresh & easy
the food was pretty bad , i would not go there again
we will not be using this location again
this is a horrible venue
you will have zero appetite after the first bite
do not go here unless you want to pay for crap
but it may not actually be in stock anyway
owner : a very rude man
this place is a terrible place to live !
stopped by for soda after being at the hobby shop next door
my dish was pretty salty and could barely taste the garlic crab
it looks like blended up chicken put into the shape of grilled pieces
what about the time i wasted ?
there are better happy hours and better beers all around mill !
the rooms are not that nice and the food is not that good either
executive chefs would walk by not even saying good morning
this spot was my favorite indian restaurant
not even real brown sauce
i will not revisit this course as a visitor with limited time to play
but was very disappointed with what actually arrived
his offer of a `` free dessert `` was even more atrocious
i was so disgusted i could not way for the rest of the day
the salads are ok , nothing special
overall it was a miserable evening
the woman did not even apologize
i expected service to be slow that morning , and it was
zero complaints with his work
the garlic bread was bland and cold
the espresso was way too hot
i know i should have sent this back and walk out
they wo not tell you though
i love the food however service here is horrible
gammage itself however is not so amazing
needless to say i will not be back for mexican food
i wo not be ordering again
let me give my opinion , that 's what this site is for
she did not apologize or anything
prices are just plain retail
but this place was not economical so the expectation was different
it smelled and tasted like yesterday 's oil
who knows , it might have been
the beer sauce is lackluster at best
the building itself looks abandoned
we have tried the cream pancakes as well
i have never had a worse experience than this !
no , i am not at a scottsdale club
if i could give zero stars i def would
only now i am really hungry , and really pissed off
no call , no nothing
i wish i could give less than one star
the wonton was seriously lacking filling
if i could give less stars , i would
she could not and would not explain herself
think twice -- this place is a dump
i am not one of the corn people
it 's always busy and the restaurant is very dirty
even if i was insanely drunk , i could not force this pizza down
as an arizona native , i have been going to the improv for years
i got there , was seated pretty quickly , and then chose my color
so , no treatment and no medication to help me deal with my condition
at this location the service was terrible
so who do i call to get my money back
overcooked so badly that it was the consistency of canned tuna fish
i am stuck in a lease otherwise i would move
service was a little slow to begin with
only then did our waitress show up with another styrofoam cup full of water
the food was so-so and very over priced for what you get
i hate to see what their delivery times are when it 's last call
just went back to get the rear tire sealed and filled
i expected so much better from this ny staple
i had to leave a message , and they never called me back
the food is worse than you find in the freezer section at walmart
they tried real hard to get me to come back but i refused
the security guard comes upstairs and pounds on our door demanding we open up
i wanted to like this place but it just became a big disappointment
i did not know worker there can get tips from customer
and the cleaning is way over priced
they make a bad name for used car dealers
when i was finally there , i was very disappointed
just a frozen patty cooked like a home one
so sad but i am not going back any more
this is the worst walmart neighborhood market out of any of them
the new management team is horrible !
just do not bother ordering anything if you are seated
they also have lost sight of what good deli food is
the evening started out slow
i replied , `` um no i am cool
the queen bed was horrible !
meanwhile i am waiting for an answer
oh , i should not have asked
my toddler found a dead mouse under one of the seats
this place is just ok
i have to say i was truly disappointed
this is the reason i will never go back
furthermore , there is no sausage or bacon on the menu
when the manager finally showed up he was rude and dismissive !
the office also failed to even apologize about this whole horrific experience
nope , way way worse
there are no smiles and no customer service
when she did not answer him quickly enough , he hung up on her
the fried rice was gross and there was a shit load of it
if your patio is south facing , you are out of luck
plus the dude did not even know how to work the computer
overall : lost my business and recommendation for a good local camera place
it was so odd , i asked her if she was joking ?
the food was mediocre at best , far too greasy and not cooked well
food was cold ( still frozen ) , i had the ribs
was not busy , no biggie
the bathroom area is nothing special
this room that he found also reeked of smoke !
also , the food that is there is not great even by buffet standards
so i brought my business elsewhere
exhibit c : no more student services peeps
so disappointing from an old favorite
it shows because on a saturday night there was not a long wait
tzatziki sauce had way too much dill in it
the texture of the meat just looked and tasted wrong
i will never visit the salon again
they only received one star because you have to provide a rating
i would not go back there again
this was by far the rudest person i spoke with
the rest of their food is edible but their employees and service are horrible
as for the food , never had it
however , the tech said nothing to me about this
i am from the bay area and this was a disappointment and over priced
my mom ordered the teriyaki chicken bento box and i ordered the sashimi box
i ordered garlic bread and fettuccine alfredo pasta with vegetables
it does not take that long to cook sliders !
the sandwich was not that great
the man did not stop her
um we just told him that we did not want to finance
tasted really old , i could not believe it
it is also quite expensive for my taste
food was alright maybe we should have ordered off the mexican menu
lastly but not least , their brownie desert was meh
it shows that this restaurant has no class
one broken thing after another they do not care to address
we have been to this long established restaurant many times
my plate looked nearly half empty except for the small container of cole slaw
when i arrived , no one was at the desk
we gave it another number-number minutes before we got up and left
even the ice cream was very , very run of the mill
wendy 's has been know to be cheap with their drink refills for years
as soon as they delivered i was like ugh
the service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average
but i darn sure could have cooked this one
just terrible is all i can say
did they not have a fountain machine on site ?
his egg sandwiches stink like feet and are slimy
stay away , and go to cheesecake instead
we stood there in shock , because we never expected this
i have eaten here many times , but none as bad as last night
always takes way too long even if you are the only one there
however , everyone else paid after their nails were completed
so , that was my one and only time ordering the benedict there
overall , i do not enjoy the place very much
one of the employees apologized , but it did not seem very sincere
there is a reason they can get you in fairly quickly
is zero stars an option ?
in the long run , they did absolutely nothing for me
but let this story begin at noon today
seriously though , i have never shopped here
it is the absolute worse place in the valley
but their inventory was questionable !
chicken fried chicken was dry but the green chili macaroni and cheese was good
so he can charge a bloody fortune for them
were we irritating her or something ?
this place has pissed me off for the last time
do not sign a lease with these people
do not waste the trip
had to returned one entree because too cold
the restroom was a mess
i mean that 's been my experience !
the beef taco was good but nothing special
either way i would never recommend buying from camping world
i went to sit down and wait for my order
its also not a very clean park
i tried to call repeatedly with no response
they charged me for work not done , and parts not installed
it looks old and outdated
he did not return my call either
if you travel a lot do not stay at this hotel
i would rather wait for hot food than have it cold and soggy
the food here is bland and boring and bad
this one is not on the ball
for the record i am a good cook , i use seasoning !
the tow package is not an issue either
very crowded , difficult to have a chance to actually have a good time
i think it 's terrible when employees act that way
i will keep looking for a different salon
you can not pay me to ever shop here !
french toast plate was good , mom said , but eggs were cold
now the food : not horrible , but below average
this is easily the worst greek food i have had in my life
no stars is what in want to give
when it came we should have sent it back
the equipment is so old and looks dirty
i am not willing to take the chance
this place smelt like old urine for some reason
bottom line they over promise and under deliver
i dont know why i was expecting anything different
nothing that special about this place
razz 's failed on every occasion
management no longer cares about the golf experience
number-number % capacity at most , i was the only one in the pool
the chow mein was very mushy and had weird texture
found the place even though it is hard due to bad signage
not sure and i do not care !
two hours of my life i can never get back
dropped off my red purse and three pair of black shoes
very disappointed and would stay clear of this place
service fair , pace was bad between courses - long waits
second time , not so good
the bread was soggy and the dip was inedible
he did not even offer another time for me to come in
what the hell are you doing ?
the lady at the front desk was not very friendly
i was not impressed , and would not recommend this place
the dipping sauce was too sweet too
finally , the cheese crisp was tiny and was anything but crisp
i checked online , and the coupon site said my certificate was good
liar , liar , pants on fire
parking : no signs or anything , so you just have to guess
i should have stuck with sun chinese dining
not so great food and service
this is an old worn out hotel
the pizza is offered without toppings and it 's lacking in flavor
the mechanics are very amateur as usual
this place is beyond a shit hole
this place is a shit hole with shit service
however , it turned out to be nothing like i thought it would
went back in for adjustment , realized still incorrect
service was just as disappointing
i do not recommend anyone to this starbucks
the only thing i was offered was a free dessert
management does not seem to care
i had a horrible experience , and i sadly would not come back
it is not really brown rice
did not even get a response
needless to say , i contacted the store manager directly after leaving
my wife came in for alterations and was treated quite rudely
i ordered a cesar salad with a side of blackened chicken
had it not been so terribly hot , it would have just been inconvenient
she did offer me a copy if i would like a soda while waiting
i emailed to let them know but they apparently dont care
i suppose id forgotten how bland their offerings really are
it did not get finished
we will not be coming back
he could not actually read her pressure , though
absolutely terrible , do not order from this place
ate kicked ass , marquee , not so much
even the water tasted horrible
and the food is simply not as good as the other locations
sounds good does not it ?
but it was disgusting and hot in there
yes , the portions were large , but size is not everything
it was over fried and very hard
i have not received such an attitude toward a customer before
the overall prices are not competitive with frys
too bad it was at the expense of the other customers
we will see if that happens , but i am not holding my breath
and management does not do anything about it
no wonder these restaurants are closing up all around the valley
what were you going to charge me when i purchase a dozen bagels ?
i am still craving my drunken noodles !
these days the quality is pretty lousy
this woman should not be in the service industry in az with that attitude
service was average but could not make up for the poor food and drink
my husband had to walk up to the bar to place our wine order
and the pizza was cold , greasy , and generally quite awful
maybe they were having a bad night ?
this place is dirty and run down and the service stinks !
the only thing we received that was hot was the coffee
so , it went in the trash
it was embarrassing for all involved , though i do not think he noticed
so i ordered my tires online , scheduled an appointment for two days out
hopefully , i do not take any bed bugs with me
the beer is not bad , but the food was less than desirable
when it finally came out , it was bad
talk about false advertising so call before you go !
the food is not too bad but the service is terrible
crab cakes , salt , no other flavor
but the customer service ruins it all for me
i just walked out , called the manager to complain
i was very disappointed with this place
so you are not my problem ``
unfortunately , the tour guides are not experts
geez i need to find a source for those uni blocks
she does not say anything and just walks away
the others ordered the short rib hash , also over-cooked and dry
the staff was nowhere to be found
it tasted like melted plastic and had the same tough consistency
it did not matter of she is good at all other times
i acknowledged this and he went back to take care of the bill
save your money & your patience
what a waste of my time and theirs
one was for my dog , and one was for my wife 's dog
my fault for not looking more closely , i guess
the server was not buying
worst customer service i have ever had
sad what has happened to this sandwich shop
and for this reason , i wo not return
this branch is getting worse and worse
they failed to tell us eating in the bar was an option
they can thank you for the low rating
i did not even eat it
this was the first time i ever cried from a haircut
there was no personality to our server
if i was not with my coworker , i would have walked out
i did not know ra was a chain
i am sure they must get it right some days but not this day
went to the sunday brunch to celebrate our daughter 's college graduation
this is the third time they have messed up that spice
the game room is a waste of time , energy and money
i also told him i would leave him some good feedback online
however , the manager came back & told me my order was coming up
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
maria the manager is a horrible person
it was so much not good that i just wanted out of there
we told them to forget it , we did not want to wait
first , the bartender was an a -- hole
absolutely ridiculous stay away from this place
i guess even great restaurants have bad days
oh well , who cares right ?
we will spend our money elsewhere
i will never purchase another lv bag again
uneven pieces and falling apart -- i paid for that
we did not leave with anything that day
horrible , horrible , horrible service !
now it is not so thin and taste like any other pizza place
this piece of shit gave me wonton crackers for my soup
i am not a fan of huge chain restaurants
the rice was cold and hard and the taste was very bland
you can not judge people based on appearance
you are not the only place in town with decent pizza
the thai basil pasta came out lukewarm and spicy
no courtesy and their food is pathetic
i would never reccomend anyone to live here
had to wait a month to get in
great food but horrible staff and very very rude workers !
it was my last weekend visiting my folks
next dish was moo goo gai pan to which the sauce is the secret
do not go here if you are interested in eating good food
prime rib was fatty and not cooked per requested
tonight i lost all respect for this company
safe to say we will be going to other walgreens locations from now on
i may make it back to the bar but i will skip the restaurant
let me tell you , this place was far from busy !
it 's not much like an actual irish pub , which is depressing
the birthday surprise has been ruined as well as her special day
included in this price was a credit card fee and an after midnight fee
the only item was able to eat was the soggy broccoli beef !
other than that , i really do not know what was good about it
the food is not that authentic
actually , just keep walking
unfortunately , it is the worst
the place has obviously gone downhill over the years
not so much these days
did not feel like dealing with the restaurants closer to asu
this is the worst panda express location there is !
the door would not open at all
my services were very rushed and she did not even do a good job
the ceiling air conditioner in the hallway is very loud
we then placed our order with our extremely rude and apparently completely overwhelmed server
i may just post pictures to prove their shoddy work
it is way overpriced ( compare to what they serve !
this is a terrible college
my jack and coke was seriously lacking
sadly , i will probably never be able to eat at this place again
the falafel 's looked like chicken nuggets , and were lacking flavor
i looked around and there were still customers
i said it was disgusting to even serve this to diners
we both found it overcooked -- and no seasonings
in turn my legs are burnt from the noodles and all over the floor
avoid if at all possible
i do not like to be screwed over , or short changed
we asked how long the wait would be , she said she was unsure
it 's just too expensive for what you get
also , could they not bring a single pack of cheese or red peppers ?
went into this location to drop it off
we went there on a busy holiday weekend and the service was extremely slow
if i was the manager , i would fire that kid on the spot
too bad too because they brew an outstanding beer
the food was low quality and thrown together quickly with little flavor
the beer was nice and cold !
the woman who works in the deli is horrible
will never go back to kfc - they essentially stole from me !
there are much better places for breakfast
the surly older waitress was a huge bummer
it 's not my fave , but it 's not awful
um , yah , it does not need replacing just yet
pathetic place , worst food
needless to say , i will not be returning to this place ever again
firstly , their fees are generally higher than other places
anything they say , ask in writing
this is a far cry from real new mexican cuisine
but unfortunately the rude woman was the one checking us out
built in cabinets in kitchen and bathroom along with sink are not kept up
bad service in these areas and really ruined our visit
if i had wanted it washed i would have washed it myself !
she just grabbed a couple empty dishes and walked off
incredible , low price specials and the occasional groupon
the green enchiladas were ok but not great
the problem is nothing was good
i tried to no avail
university is also almost as bad as living on apache
horrible job on nails and toes
i refused to purchase any of the pictures based on quality
perhaps bread should be offered at no charge
simply , there are far superior places to go for sushi
took my suite to get fitted and a new button put on it
sketchy sketchy sketchy pizza delivery !
that person didnt get their meal until everyone else was finished with their meal
the place is small , i am sure she could have figured it out
they rush , rush and do not pay attention to their customers
desert followed but nothing special
no massage with my manicure or pedicure
i called at number : number and got the complete brush off
however , this experience went pretty smooth
they are nowhere near any fight that breaks out
since their visit , the only scorpions we have seen were dead !
she was getting pissed , and so were we
did not seem to care about their job
would have rated lower if i could
not personalized or warm at all
so one person would eat while everyone else was sitting and waiting for theirs
i do not like the size of the dance floor
this location is super busy and really could use double the staff
i guess starbucks customer services is only good at some locations
their cheese i am certain was of the string variety
no , not the ones at asu , the ones in junior high
three women met for lunch last friday at elements at the sanctuary
ra sushi , you are so blah to me
half of my head was over processed
an old dude did my pedicure
like it 's been in a fridge for a week
`` no , we are going to have a tournament tomorrow
when i picked up the order , i was given another totally different price
they do not stock some of the most common parts
it 's small yet they make you feel like a stranger
i wo not be going back and suffering at this terrible place !
the drinks were expensive and half full
my husband got a reuben sandwich , he hated it
